# AWS-Data-Analytics-Challenges

## DAY 1

1. What is AWS S3 ?
2. What are the few ways to upload a file to AWS S3 ( Practice it through manually, AWS CLI and Python Boto 3 ) ?
3. Imagine you have 100 CSV files in S3 ? How do you query them efficiently using AWS Athena services ( when i say efficiently, I am concerned about cost optmization techniques if possible ?)
